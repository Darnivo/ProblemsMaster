# Explanation

This is a repository of binus-themed coding problems, separated into three difficulties, Questions (and the explanations) are in the .md files, while the quiz input files are in the corresponding .txt files. The .ipynb files hold the code used to generate the input set & a basic (and probably not the most efficient) algorithm to solve the questions.

The problems are made by myself, with the 2 part format taking inspiration from Advent of Code, designed to be hosted on a Web-Programming course project.
