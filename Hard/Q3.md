# --- Q-3 Hard: Vending machine --- 

## Part 1

You are tasked by your boss to figure out which of your fellow interns should get a reward based on the amount of hours they spent working in the last 3 days. unfortunately the system used for managing work hour data only stores the daily work session as a binary array of `0s` and `1s`, with **1** indicating a work period of an hour. Since your boss value hard work, each worker is given a score, calculated by multiplying the total amount of work in the period and the longest streak by said worker. Afterwards, you should calculate the amount of workers who reached a minimum score of **280** by the amount of workers who failed to reach it.

For example of a worker transcript:
`000000 010000 111111 110000`
`000011 000000 000000 000111`
`111111 111000 000110 000010`

In total, the workers worked for a total of **26** hours, and had the longest streak of **12** hours (3 hours 2nd day and continuing in day 3 for 9 more hours). Which earns him a score of **312**(23*9), meaning he is one of the interns who qualifies for a bonus.
