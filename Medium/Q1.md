# --- Q-1 Medium: Micro problems --- 

## Part 1

After the mid exams, A certain lecturer asked you to find the median grade of all the classes she teaches. You are tasked to find the median grade of each class, and then find the difference between the highest and the lowest performing class.

Note: the amount of students per class will always be odd, but can range between a total of 15 to 33 students

For example:
`66 79 90 56 100`, the median for this class would be 79
`10 20 30 40 50` would be 30
`36 70 33 100 83` would be 70
For this set of classes, the final answer would be **49** (79-30)

(note that the actual data will be much larger than this)

## Part 2

#### Congratulations, you got part 1 correct!

Now that you have the median gap, please calculate the sum of all the difference between each class' median and the overall median

Going back to the example, you would get `30 + 19 + 21`, totaling up to **70**
