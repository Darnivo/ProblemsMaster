# --- Q-2 Medium: Rubber rooms --- 

## Part 1

Find yourself going crazy after studying for lab quizzes, you found yourself in a room filled with RATs (randomly assigned tuples). To escape this room you must sort the tuples in order, and then sum the original position of said tuple multiplied with its current position.

For example:
`1. 1 2 5`
`2. 1 2 3`
`3. 1 1 1`
`4. 6 5 6`
`5. 7 5 6`
`6. 3 4 5`

(note that the row number is not actually listed and is just there for easy visualization)


When sorted, you would get:

`3. 1 1 1`
`2. 1 2 3`
`1. 1 2 5`
`6. 3 4 5`
`4. 6 5 6`
`5. 7 5 6`

For this example, the result would be `3*1 + 2*2 + 1*3 + 6*4 + 4*5 + 5*6` = **84**.


## Part 2

#### Congratulations, you got part 1 correct!

Now sort it descending, whats the value now?
