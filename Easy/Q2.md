# --- Q-2 Easy: Polygon be gone! --- 

## Part 1

In the magical world of polygonland where the rectangles live in peace, you are tasked to vanquish the the evil squares from this world. In each line you are given the Height x Width of the citizens of polygonland (maximum of 20). You are tasked to find the total perimeter of all polygons which has their area 

examples:
1. `3 12` would give an area of 36, equivalent to the area of a square with a side of 6, meaning you ignore this one
2. `4 8` 32 is not the area of any square, therefore you take its perimeter (24).
3. `3 3` is a square, ignore it
4. `9 2` is not a square so you take its perimeter (22).

For this example your answer will me **46**.

## Part 2

#### Congratulations, you got part 1 correct!

To defeat all the squares, you must perform a magic ritual that requires you to find the total area of the squares, take the last two digits of the answer, and then perform a modulo operation of your part 1 answer with that value.

Back to the example, you have `36 + 9 = 45`, and the result of 46%45 is **1**.
