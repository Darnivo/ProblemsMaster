# --- Q-3 Easy: Troubles to tally the tournament? --- 

## Part 1

You are tasked to oversee the rector cup scores of 5 teams (ranging from A-E). the teams will compete againsts each other for an unknown number of times and have 4 different outcomes:
A. 0 = means the first team wins and gets a point
B. 1 = means the second team won and gets a point, **AND** the first team loses a point
C. 2 = both team gets a point
D. 3. = both teams gets deducted a point 

(note that points cannot go below zero)

example of a simple 2 round match:
`A B 0` would result in the total scores of `A=1 B=0 C=0 D=0 E=0`
`A C 1` would then result in the total scores of `A=0 B=0 C=1 D=0 E=0`
`A C 1` would then result in the total scores of `A=0 B=0 C=2 D=0 E=0`

At the end of all the tournaments, you are tasked to find the winning team and their score

For this example your answer will be **C2**.

## Part 2

#### Congratulations, you got part 1 correct!

The tournament organizers have suddenly changed their rules, meaning that team scores can fall below 0

Going back to the example:
`A B 0` would still result in the total scores of `A=1 B=0 C=0 D=0 E=0`
`A C 1` would then result in the total scores of  `A=0 B=0 C=1 D=0 E=0` 
`A C 1` would then result in the total scores of `A=-1 B=0 C=2 D=0 E=0`

After all matches are performed,if any teams still has a negative score, all teams will have their scores have their scores added by the amount of the worst performing team.so for the scores:
`A` is under 0 and the worst performing team so the the equalization score is `1`, added to all the teams, making the scoreboard:
`A=0 B=1 C=3 D=1 E=1`

As a result your answer will now be **C3**.
